# Cleaning code
![cover][cover]
This assignmet was about getting data in a .txt format and to transform this into a csv file so that the machine is able to read and plot a graph.

## Data
The graph is about showing the temperature of places on different time.
The color tells you which place the line belongs to.
The X-as show when the measure has been done
The Y-as is the temperature that is measured.

Someplaces doesnt have a measurement that's why they will be on the bottom of the graph
