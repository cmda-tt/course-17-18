# Bar Chart Assignment
### Creating a bar chart thats showes the Battery use of my mobile apps

I have created a bar chart for the Frontend 3 course. My first job was to search for a easy bar chart that i could adjust. I used the [Basic Bar Charts](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Gallery#basic-charts) link and found [this chart](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3885304). 

### The Data

In my bar chart i've used the following data:

* **App**	      **Frequencie**
* Spotify	  .26000
* Instagram	.20000
* Safari	  .12000
* Snapchat	.06000
* Facebook	.05000
* Mail	    .04000
* Nu.nl	    .04000

The x-axis will feature the application

The y-axis will feature the percentage of battery use
